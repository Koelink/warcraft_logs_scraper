Settings are for the ADC guild

Needs a "secret.json" to work with 1 line:
{
  "public_key": your public key
}

you can find this under Web API Keys in your settings under https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/profile

Needs an "characters.xlsx" with 1 header: "char_name". Put the list with characters under that header.

Only works with classic atm.
